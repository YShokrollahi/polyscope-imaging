## About Us

### Developers
Polyscope was originally developed by researchers in Dr. Yinyin Yuan's lab at [The Institute of Cancer Research, London](https://www.icr.ac.uk/){target="_blank"}. After Dr. Yuan moved to [The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/){target="_blank"}, we continue adding to its features at [Yuan Lab](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/yuan-laboratory.html){target="_blank"}. The current Polyscope version ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/idso-fa1-pathology/polyscope){target="_blank"}) is built upon the published version ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/polyscope/polyscope){target="_blank"}) where [Sebastian Schmittner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-schmittner-96b040a6/){target="_blank"} was the main contributor. Current developers include [Simon Castillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-castillo-95b08b3a/){target="_blank"}, [Zhuohe Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhuoheliu/){target="_blank"}, [Yasin Shokrollahi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yshokrollahi/){target="_blank"} (ordered by last name). We are expanding Polyscope users from both within MD Anderson and outside collaborators, and we are happy to hear your feedback and requests.
