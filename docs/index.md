# Introduction

!!! abstract "Our Mission"
    Polyscope bridges pathology and data science for collaborative, AI-assisted image analysis.

## What?

Polyscope is a web application for image sharing and annotation collection for digital pathology. Our aim is to connect our target users, pathologists, to data scientists, who are developing machine learning (ML) models for cancer diagnosis. In Polyscope, large whole-slide images can be explored in a web browser with fast response and a simplistic user interface. It supports single-cell annotations and tissue segmentation that we can collect to train ML models or visualize to validate the prediction of these models. 

## Why?

Polyscope doesn't require installation or local storage at the users end. Polyscope can be accessed from almost all modern web browsers, including mobile devices. Polyscope supports a wide range of image formats. Sharing a view of a slide can be as easy as sharing a URL link. By using Polyscope, you have the chance to work with its developers, a team of data scientists and pathologists, and collaborate with them first-hand to form collobration and publish findings together, as opposed to developers of other software whom might not have the expertise in cancer research. Importantly, Polyscope further supports AI integration for AI-assisted pathology review and validation experience, with interactive controls for close-loop workflows.
