    Image page offers interactive view of the image and enables annotation collection.

## View Images

### View Modes

The goal of the **Image Page** is to let users view and annotate images. This page can be configured to two modes: 

* **Polyzoomer**: referring to a single image view.
* **Multizoomer**: referring to a combination of multiple image views. 

Before you start, make sure you choose a set of annotation shapes and colors to be used for each semenatic class to ensure consistency. Once an annotation is created, it cannot be edited (shape or color) unless it is deleted and recreated.

### Delete Annotations

To delete an annotation, double click on it and click 'Yes' in the popup message box. Multiple annotations must be deleted one by one.

Deletion cannot be undone by the user. However, deleted annotations are recorded and can be retrieved for later analysis if necessary.

### Download Annotations

Annotations created in Polyscope can be exported to common [formats](#annotation-format) such as CSV and JSON, as well as Polyscope TXT format. Click the **:octicons-download-24:Export** button on the top right and select **Annotations TXT** menu option to download the annotations in Polyscope .txt format. Other formats follow similarly. Annotations can be downloaded at any time and multiple times if needed. 

!!! important
    Since the annotation file does not contain corresponding source image information, it is recommended to name the file properly with relevant information. 

### Annotation Format

#### TXT Annotation Format

We save the following properties of annotations, one row per annotations. The description of columns ordered from left to right are: 

* Annotation state: `0` = deleted, `1` = active. 
* Index: started from one, ordered by creation or deletion time. 
* Shape type: `0` = line segment, `1` = arrow, `2` = rectangle, `3` = ellipse, `4` = freehand, `5` = text, `6` = point.
* Data, depending on the shape type: 
  * Line segment, arrow: a list of 2 (x, y) coordinates denoting start and end points, e.g. `[(0.1,0.2),(0.3,0.4)]`.
  * Rectangle, ellipse: a list of 2 (x, y) coordinates denoting the top-left and bottom-right corners, e.g. `[(0.1,0.2),(0.3,0.4)]`.
  * Freehand: a list of (x, y) coordinates of variable length, e.g. `[(0.1,0.2),(0.3,0.4),...]`.
  * Text: a list of a (x, y) coordinate and text string, e.g. `[(0.1,0.2),'text']`.
  * Point: a list of 2 (x, y) duplicated coordinates, marking the point location, e.g. `[(0.1,0.2),(0.1,0.2)]`.
  * Note that coordinate values for **both x and y axes** are normalized to 0 to 1 according to the **width** of the slide.
* Color: in hex such as `#ffffff`. 
* Created date and time: in the format of `d/m/yyyy/HH:mm:ss` in local time zone.

#### Annotation File Examples

For example, different formats of the same rectangle annotation are shown below: 

=== "TXT"

    ```
    1,1,2,[(0.1,0.2),(0.3,0.4)],#ff0000,1/8/2025/14:35:12
    ```

=== "CSV"

    ``` csv
    
    ```

=== "JSON"

    ``` json
    {}

### Annotation Statistics

In the **Annotation** section of the **Analysis Tools** side panel, you can view a real-time summary of created annotations. The statistics include counts of each annotation types. 

## Link Sharing

You can bookmark and share the URL of the current image page with others for collaboration. The **:material-share-variant:Share** button on the top right offers convenient sharing options. 

!!! example
    A Polyzoomer/Multizoomer link might look like this: `.../customers/jsmith1-mdanderson-org/Path000001_202402061731/page/test001/index.html`. You may omit the `index.html` part.

!!! warning
