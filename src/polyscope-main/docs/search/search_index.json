Polyscope is a web application for image sharing and annotation collection for digital pathology. Our aim is to connect our target users, pathologists, to data scientists, who are developing machine learning (ML) models for cancer diagnosis. In Polyscope, large whole-slide images can be explored in a web browser with fast response and a simplistic user interface. It supports single-cell annotations and tissue segmentation that we can collect to train ML models or visualize to validate the prediction of these models. Why? Polyscope supports a wide range of image formats. Sharing a view of a slide can be as easy as sharing a URL link. By using Polyscope, you have the chance to work with its developers, a team of data scientists and pathologists, and collaborate with them first-hand to form collobration and publish findings together, as opposed to developers of other software whom might not have the expertise in cancer research. Compared with existing software such as QuPath , Polyscope doesn't require installation or local storage at the users end. Polyscope can be accessed from almost all modern web browsers, including mobile devices. Who? Polyscope was originally developed by researchers in Dr. Yinyin Yuan's lab at The Institute of Cancer Research, London . After Dr. Yuan moved to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , we continue adding to its features at Yuan Lab . The current Polyscope version ( GitHub Repository ) is built upon the published version ( GitHub repository ) where Sebastian Schmittner was the main contributor. Current developers include Simon Castillo , Yasin Shokrollahi , Zhuohe Liu , etc. We are expanding Polyscope users from both within MD Anderson and outside collaborators, and we are happy to hear your feedback and requests. You have the following options to report bugs, request features, or ask questions: Send an email to the official support email address polyscope_admin@mdanderson.org . Create an issue on the GitHub issue page . Reach out to individual developers directly through their MD Anderson emails. How? Polyscope home page is at https://polyscope.mdanderson.org/ .

Index Page Login Navigate to the index page of Polyscope https://polyscope.mdanderson.org/ . Most broswers are supported including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Polyscope is accessible both within and outside MD Anderson. You need to log in to upload data and generate slide views. To log in, enter your MD Anderson username and password. You will be automatically logged out after 45 minutes of inactivity. After login, the index page will show either of the following three views: (1) Splash Screen , (2) File Browser , and (3) Job Status . Splash Screen After login, you will first see the Splash Screen . The clock indicates periodic page refresh, the traffic light indicates CPU workload, and the pie chart indicates available storage. The view will display briefly and then turns to the File Browser view. Use the red arrows on the bottom to switch between the three views. File Browser File Browser is where you select files to be imported and preprocessed to create slide views. To select files, first click on the list on the left to select a drive, after which the files within will be listed on the treeview to the right. Select one or mulitple files using the checkboxes, and click the yellow 'Polyzoomer' button on the lower left to submit the files for batch processing. Your user folder is located at /rsrch9/home/plm/polyscope/media/Users/ . You can add data by either copying from the research drive or uploading files directly from your browser. Folder and file names must not contain spaces ( ). To upload files, click the green upload icon next to the subfolder. Supported formats include svs , ndpi , tiff , jpg , and png , with a file size limit of 5 GB . Multiple files can be uploaded concurrently. Currently, adding new folders, renaming, or deleting folders and files is not supported. Job Status Job status view displays the queue of files to be processed. If you see red 'Please enter your email' label next to the job, click it to type in your username (i.e. email) in the popup onscreen keyboard. After hitting 'Return' or press 'Enter' key, you will see the green 'Email Ok!' label, indicating the email is accepted. You will see the job status evolve from checksum, pending, upload, uploading, uploaded, inQueue, processing, finished, emailSent, all the way to readyToBeRemoved. Normally, preprocessing of a file takes somewhere around 1 to 10 minumtes. After the job is finished, it will be removed from the list. Processed files can then be viewed in the User Page . User Page Link: https://polyscope.mdanderson.org/customers/<your_email>/ From the index page , click 'Customers' in the navigation bar to go to the user page. You have access only to your own user directory under .../customers/<your_email> where <your_email> is your email address/username where @ and . is replaced by - . For example, for jsmith1@mdanderson.org , the user page is located at .../customers/jsmith1-mdanderson-org/ . Use the buttons to the left to organize the imported files. From top to bottom: (1) delete selected file(s); (2) create new folders; (3) sort file list. To move file(s) to a folder, either drag the selected files to the destination folder, or use context menu to 'copy' or 'cut' and then 'paste'. A 'Polyzoomer' view may contain one slide/file, or more than one, which is called 'Multizoomer'. In a 'Multizoomer' view, the display areas of each file are synchronized across user's pan and zoom actions. To create a Multizoomer view, drag one or more files to the right side of the user page. When all files are added, click the 'multizoom' button on the left to create the view. This will be added to the list of files on the left. Double click on the thumbnail of a 'Polyzoomer' or 'Multizoomer' to open them in the Slide Page . Note that changes (annotation edits) to the underlying polyzoomer files will propogate to the dependent Multizoomer views. Slide Page The goal of the Slide Page is to let users view and annotate slides. This page can be configured to two modes: Polyzoomer : referring to a single slide view. Multizoomer : referring to a combination of multiple slide views. Before you start, make sure you choose a set of annotation shapes and colors to be used for each semenatic class to ensure consistency. Once an annotation is created, it cannot be edited (shape or color) unless it is deleted and recreated. View Controls On the top left of the slide view, you will find the following view control buttons: Click + or - , press - or = keys, or use mouse scroll to zoom. Double left click to zoom in. Press arrow keys or wasd keys or drag with left mouse button to pan. Click the house icon to reset the view. Click 'toggle full page' to display the current slide in full screen. Click \u2ba3 or \u2ba2 icons to rotate the slide 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, respectively. Annotation Controls On the lower right of the slide view, you will find the following annotation control buttons: Click \u25a1 icon and drag on the slide using left mouse button to add a rectangle annotation. Click \u25cb icon and drag on the slide using left mouse button to add an ellipse annotation. Click \u27cb icon and drag on the slide using left mouse button to add a line segment annotation. Click \u2b69 icon and drag on the slide using left mouse button to add an arrow annotation from tail to head. Click T icon to add a text annotation. In the popup window, type in the text after the prompt 'Please enter the annotation text'. Click 'OK' to add the annotation. Click the pen icon and drag on the slide using left mouse button to draw a freehand annotation. Click . icon and left click on the slide to add a point annotation. Click the 'select color' icon and click on the popup color swatches to change the annotation color. Note that once an annotation is created, it cannot be edited (shape or color) unless it is deleted and recreated. To delete an annotation, double click on it and click 'Yes' in the popup message box. Annotations are automatically saved and you can safely close the browser window whenever you want. Download Annotations Click the 'Download Annotations' green button on top of the page to download the annotations in .txt format. In the txt, we save the following properties of annotations, one row per annotations. The description of columns ordered from left to right are: Annotation state: 0 = deleted, 1 = active. Index: started from one, ordered by creation or deletion time. Shape type: 0 = line segment, 1 = arrow, 2 = rectangle, 3 = ellipse, 4 = freehand, 5 = text, 6 = point. Data, depending on the shape type: Line segment, arrow: a list of 2 (x, y) coordinates denoting start and end points, e.g. [(0.1,0.2),(0.3,0.4)] . Rectangle, ellipse: a list of 2 (x, y) coordinates denoting the top-left and bottom-right corners, e.g. [(0.1,0.2),(0.3,0.4)] . Freehand: a list of (x, y) coordinates of variable length, e.g. [(0.1,0.2),(0.3,0.4),...] . Text: a list of a (x, y) coordinate and text string, e.g. [(0.1,0.2),'text'] . Point: a list of 2 (x, y) duplicated coordinates, marking the point location, e.g. [(0.1,0.2),(0.1,0.2)] . Note that coordinate values for both x and y axes are normalized to 0 to 1 according to the width of the slide. Color: in hex such as #ffffff. Created date and time: in the format of d/m/yyyy/HH:mm:ss in local time zone. Since the annotation file does not contain corresponding slide information, it is recommended to rename the file immediately after downloading. Annotations can be downloaded at any time and multiple times if needed. Statistics At the bottom of the page, you can view a real-time summary of created annotations. The statistics include counts of each annotation types. Link Sharing You can bookmark and share the URL of the current slide view with others for collaboration.

For more detailed information, refer to the Documentation . Introduction Multizoomer is a powerful tool that enables synchronized viewing of multiple images. It is particularly useful for: Displaying slide annotations from multiple sources. Viewing multiple imaging channels simultaneously. Comparing different imaging modalities of adjacent tissue. Visualizing AI model outputs alongside original images. A Multizoomer is composed of multiple Polyzoomers. Importantly, it does not duplicate the underlying Polyzoomers; this means that any annotation changes propagate bidirectionally, ensuring data consistency. However, if a Polyzoomer is deleted, a blank view will appear in its place within the Multizoomer. Creating a Multizoomer To create a Multizoomer, follow these steps: Drag individual Polyzoomers onto the right side of the interface to configure the Multizoomer layout. It is recommended to use a maximum of two columns for better organization. While the system supports an unlimited number of views, keeping it to around six views ensures clarity and usability. Click the Create Multizoomer button to finalize the layout. This action will navigate to the newly created Multizoomer page. Click the \u03b1 (alpha) button to designate one Polyzoomer as the reference Polyzoomer. The reference Polyzoomer controls synchronized actions across all views (explained in the next section). Multizoomer Interaction Once a Multizoomer is created, interactions are synchronized based on the reference Polyzoomer: Pan and zoom movements applied to the reference Polyzoomer will be mirrored across all other Polyzoomers in the Multizoomer. Other operations will function as they do on an individual Polyzoomer. Sharing a Multizoomer Sharing a Multizoomer is straightforward: The URL of the Multizoomer page serves as the shareable link. Example: https://polyscope.mdanderson.org/customers/jsmith1-mdanderson-org/multizooms/Path000009_202502041751/page/INDEX/ The link is publicly accessible, so it is advisable to keep it confidential. It can be accessed both inside and outside MD Anderson without requiring a VPN. Since a Multizoomer depends on its source Polyzoomers, consider creating multiple Polyzoomers from a single slide if you need to share them with different individuals independently. By following these steps, you can efficiently create, interact with, and share Multizoomers for various imaging and annotation tasks.","title":"Tutorial 3 (Multizoomer)"},{"location":"tutorial_multizoomer/#tutorial-3-create-and-view-a-multizoomer","text":"This tutorial covers the creation and viewing of a Multizoomer, synchronized viewing of multiple slide views.

It is particularly useful for: Displaying slide annotations from multiple sources. Viewing multiple imaging channels simultaneously. Comparing different imaging modalities of adjacent tissue. Visualizing AI model outputs alongside original images. A Multizoomer is composed of multiple Polyzoomers. Importantly, it does not duplicate the underlying Polyzoomers; this means that any annotation changes propagate bidirectionally, ensuring data consistency. However, if a Polyzoomer is deleted, a blank view will appear in its place within the Multizoomer.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"tutorial_multizoomer/#creating-a-multizoomer","text":"To create a Multizoomer, follow these steps: Drag individual Polyzoomers onto the right side of the interface to configure the Multizoomer layout.

For more detailed information, refer to the Documentation . Access Polyscope\u2019s Polyzoomer Page The URL of a Polyzoomer page serves as its shareable link, for example: https://polyscope.mdanderson.org/customers/jsmith1-mdanderson-org/Path000010_202502182331/page/test001/ . This link is accessible to everyone, so it is important to keep it confidential. Polyscope is available both within and outside MD Anderson without the need for a VPN. A desktop browser is recommended for the best experience, but mobile devices with touchscreens are also supported. While co-editing is possible, it is recommended to use only one tab per link to avoid conflicts. Create Annotations and Their Types Before starting an annotation task, consult the annotation requester to determine the appropriate annotation type. Since Polyscope does not save color code descriptions, it is advised to record the color coding before beginning annotation work. To set a color, click the \u2018color picker\u2019 tool. Click on an annotation type icon to enter annotation mode; clicking the icon again will exit this mode. Point annotation : Each left-click creates one annotation. Freehand drawing : Left-click and drag to draw. Rectangle annotation : Left-click to define one corner, then drag and release to set the opposite corner. The color can be changed during annotation mode. For additional annotation types, refer to the Documentation . Edit and Delete Annotations Annotations cannot be moved or resized after creation. If changes are needed, the annotation must be deleted and recreated. To delete an annotation, click on it and follow the prompt. Multiple annotations must be deleted one by one. Deletion cannot be undone by the user. However, deleted annotations are recorded and can be retrieved for later analysis if necessary. Review Annotations Basic interactions within the annotation viewer include: Pan : Use mouse drag, arrow keys, or WASD keys. Zoom : Use the mouse scroll wheel or the - and = ( + ) keys. Full screen : Click the full-screen icon for an expanded view. Annotation statistics are displayed in the top-right panel. Annotations should refresh automatically, but if they do not, try refreshing the page or reopening the tab. For more details on view controls, refer to the Documentation . Download Annotations Click the \u2018Download\u2019 button to save annotations as a .txt file. Polyscope uses a proprietary annotation format, where each row represents one annotation. Deleted annotations are also recorded. Since the annotation file does not contain corresponding slide information, it is recommended to rename the file immediately after downloading.
